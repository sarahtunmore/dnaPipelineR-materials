The Chair,"The debate on Government amendment 204 to schedule 7 has already commenced. Schedule 7  Transitional and saving provision relating to Part 5  Amendment proposed (this day): 204, in schedule 7, page 148, line 28, at end insert-  ""10A (1) Where-  (a) a slavery and trafficking prevention order requires a person to notify the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority in accordance with section 19 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 ('the 2015 Act'), and  (b) immediately before the day on which paragraph 53 of Schedule 6 comes into force, that requirement has not been complied with,  that requirement has effect, on and after that day, as a requirement to notify the Secretary of State. (2) On and after the coming into force of paragraph 54 of Schedule 6, the reference in section 20(2)(g) of the 2015 Act (as amended by that paragraph) to a slavery and trafficking prevention order made on an application under section 15 of that Act by the Secretary of State includes a reference to such an order made on an application under that section by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority.",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con),"Government amendment 204 is crucial to ensuring that functions currently performed by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 continue seamlessly after the powers are transferred to the Secretary of State. As part of the broader restructuring outlined in the Bill, those functions will be absorbed into the newly established fair work agency, which will take on the role of overseeing labour rights and enforcement activities. It is essential that the transfer of these powers does not lead to any gaps in the enforcement of laws relating to modern slavery, human trafficking and labour exploitation.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con),"The GLAA has played a pivotal role in investigating and combating labour abuse, particularly in high-risk sectors such as agriculture, horticulture and construction. By ensuring the smooth continuation of these functions under the fair work agency, we are reinforcing our commitment to protecting vulnerable workers and ensuring that modern slavery offences are actively pursued. Moreover, the amendment will guarantee that the dedicated focus on tackling labour exploitation is preserved even as responsibilities shift.",STATUS
Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con),"The fair work agency will now serve as the central body for enforcing these laws, and it is critical that its operations are fully equipped to carry forward the work done by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, particularly in investigating and preventing cases of modern slavery. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister for a more detailed assessment of how the creation of the fair work agency will enhance our ability to identify and prevent modern slavery offences. Given the increasing complexity of labour exploitation and the fact that modern slavery offences often take place in hidden, clandestine environments, the need for a robust, dedicated enforcement body is more pressing than ever.",EQUAL
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business and Trade (Justin Madders),"Member for Mid Buckinghamshire asked how this measure will make things more effective. I refer him to the evidence given by a number of stakeholders, including the Director of Labour Market Enforcement, Margaret Beels, who explained that the current fragmented system makes it difficult to ensure that intelligence is shared correctly.",GENERAL
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business and Trade (Justin Madders),"A lot of the people engaged in labour market abuses are operating under the radar, and therefore anything we can do to ensure that intelligence is shared and resources are combined has to be a good thing, so that these abuses are stamped out.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"It therefore underpins the enforcement purposes of the Bill. Clause 112 defines the key terms used throughout part 5 of the Bill relating to the governance of the fair work agency, including the concepts of the advisory board, the enforcement function and the role of an enforcement officer under clauses 75, 73 and 72, respectively. Other key terms defined by the clause include labour market enforcement undertakings and orders, ""non-compliance with relevant labour market legislation"" and ""labour market offence"".",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"It does not introduce any additional policy, but it is a necessary and normal part of the Bill to ensure that it is functional.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"New clause 7 and amendment 110 have been tabled to fix an apparent drafting error in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. The Committee has already debated a Government amendment to section 285(1B) of that Act, which will close a loophole in the requirement to notify the UK Government of collective redundancies for foreign-flagged ships. New clause 7 and amendment 110 concern subsections (1) and (1A) of the same section.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"Section 285(1) currently disapplies the collective redundancy notification requirements and certain other requirements for employees who are ""working""-as opposed to ""ordinarily working""-outside Great Britain, and section 285(1A) disapplies the requirements of sections 145A to 151 of the 1992 Act,  ""where under his contract personally to do work or perform services a worker who is not an employee works outside Great Britain."" This, unfortunately, could have the effect of excluding employees who spend any of their working time outside the UK from the requirements of the legislation.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,I hope that Members can see that this is an important and necessary change.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"I am not aware of whether there is any specific reason, other than that, although this measure is quite important in its scope, it will not actually have too much of a practical day-to-day effect.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"New Clause 8  Power to enter dwelling subject to warrant  ""(1) An enforcement officer may not by virtue of section 79 enter any dwelling unless a justice has issued a warrant authorising the officer to enter the dwelling. (2) A justice may issue a warrant under this section only if, on an application by the officer, the justice is satisfied-  (a) that the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that-  (i) there are documents in the dwelling which for any enforcement purpose the officer wishes to inspect, examine or seize, or  (ii) there is computer or other equipment in the dwelling to which the officer wishes to have access for any enforcement purpose, and  (b) that any of the conditions in subsection (3) is satisfied. (3) The conditions are-  (a) that it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant entry to the dwelling;  (b) that it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant access to the documents or equipment;  (c) that entry to the dwelling is unlikely to be granted unless a warrant is produced;  (d) that the purpose of entry may be frustrated or seriously prejudiced unless an enforcement officer arriving at the dwelling can secure immediate entry to it.",EQUAL
Justin Madders,"This group concerns the mandatory seafarers' charter and amendments to international maritime convention measures. New schedule 3, and consequential amendments new clause 48 and Government amendments 206 to 208, deliver on our commitment to introduce a legally binding seafarers' charter. The actions of P&amp;O Ferries in 2022, when it sacked almost 800 seafarers in order to replace them with agency workers on much worse terms and conditions, highlighted the lack of protections for those working on the frequent international services that keep our country moving.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"We are expanding the scope of the Seafarers Wages Act 2023, which will become the Seafarers (Wages and Working Conditions) Act 2023. The Act currently makes payment of the national minimum wage equivalent for work in UK waters a condition of port access for international services that call at a UK port at least 120 times a year. It does that by requiring harbour authorities to request declarations from operators to confirm that they are paying the national minimum wage equivalent, or they will impose surcharges each time a vessel enters the port.",WAGES
Justin Madders,Non-payment of surcharges will result in access to the port being refused.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The new schedule introduces provisions that, once the necessary regulations have been made, will require harbour authorities to also request safe working declarations and remuneration declarations from operators in scope. Operators will be required to confirm that they are meeting the requirements of those declarations, which will be set out in regulations. We will consult on the requirements and the services they will apply to in due course.",SECURITY
Justin Madders,"Safe working regulations can specify conditions relating to working patterns and rest requirements, including maximum periods of work and minimum periods of rest. They can also require operators to produce fatigue management plans, and make provision relating to safety training of seafarers. Remuneration regulations may specify requirements relating to the remuneration of seafarers, whether in UK waters or outside them.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"Operators that provide false or misleading declarations, or act inconsistently with declarations, will be guilty of an offence under the Seafarers Wages Act. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency will be responsible for enforcing those offences, as it is for the existing provisions of the Act. The new schedule represents a proportionate and necessary approach to ensuring that the seafarers who serve our country are not subject to dangerous or unfair working conditions.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"It will level the playing field by setting an appropriate minimum standard for seafarers, which will ensure that good employers are not undercut by those willing to exploit their workers.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"The new clause will fix a powers gap that was left following Brexit. It will give us the powers to make regulations under the negative procedure giving effect to the maritime labour convention and the work in fishing convention, and to make regulations giving effect to any other international agreements ratified in the UK relating to maritime employment. The first time that regulations are made in relation to a particular agreement, they will be subject to the affirmative procedure, and subsequent regulations relating to that agreement will be subject to the negative procedure.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The new clause allows for regulations to make the necessary provisions to give effect to the conventions in question. For example, it allows for regulations to make provision relating to monitoring compliance, and to criminal offences and detention of ships for contravention of provisions in the regulations. It may not represent any changes in Government policy, but it will allow us to uphold our existing obligations and any future obligations under conventions that the UK may choose to ratify.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"As I said, the maritime labour convention was adopted on 23 February 2006, and the work in fishing convention on 14 June 2007, so the first question is why the then Labour Government did not see fit to introduce provision in legislation in the first place? Will the Minister explain why it is necessary to legislate to give the Secretary of State sweeping powers to  ""by regulations make such provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for the purpose of giving effect""  to those two conventions? Precisely what regulations are needed?",GENERAL
Greg Smith,I do not think it is good enough for us to be in this position.,GENERAL
Greg Smith,"Will the Minister explain which of the rights I just outlined are not already enforceable under United Kingdom law? Is there difficulty with implementing any of the implementation and enforcement responsibilities in article V? Will the Minister further explain whether any of the provisions of the work in fishing convention are currently unenforceable under United Kingdom law-I seek just one example-and if so, what specific changes would be needed to enforce them?",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"Precisely what does the Minister mean by it? To convince the Committee that these powers are necessary, can the Minister name one occasion on which the Government's ability to enforce the provisions of the maritime labour convention has been found wanting, and in what respect? If such an example exists, could the Government better target the powers in proposed new section 84B(4) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to actually solve the problem, rather than allow a Government free-for-all?",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"As if the Government had not hoarded enough power through this new clause, proposed new section 84B(8) contains the real kicker, stating that regulations may  ""make different provision for different purposes"". Will the Minister explain the limits on this power? That language is far too woolly and loose to be contained in any piece of primary legislation in this country.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"I also do not think it is appropriate that regulations to  ""make such provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to an international agreement that has been ratified by the United Kingdom, so far as the agreement relates to maritime employment""  should be subject to the negative procedure. The regulations apply to international agreements that have not yet been entered into. Parliament should at least be guaranteed the ability to debate regulations that implementing such agreements.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The Government tabled new clause 52 just in time for debate today; we have been given very little opportunity to scrutinise it. Given the powers it takes for Ministers, I gently suggest that that is discourteous to the House. The least the Minister can do is provide answers to each of the questions I have posed, so that we are able to understand a little better whether the new clause is even necessary and to what use Ministers actually intend to put the powers.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"The maritime labour convention, which was adopted on 23 February 2006, and the work in fishing convention, adopted on 14 June 2007, represent significant international agreements aimed at improving the working conditions and rights of seafarers and those working in the fishing industry. However, despite their adoption many years ago, the provisions in those conventions have not yet been fully legislated for within the UK framework. One must ask why the previous Labour Government did not introduce this crucial provision into UK law during their time in office.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"The conventions were in existence long before the current Government came to power, and it is concerning that they were not prioritised earlier. What led to that omission, and why has it taken so long to bring them into the scope of our legislation? Given the importance of these rights, we must understand why it has taken so long for the Government to act on these matters.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,It is important to explore whether such overreach is truly necessary and what specific circumstances justify such broad powers.,GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"A fundamental part of this debate revolves around the question: what regulations are actually required to implement the two conventions? Although the Government claim that the regulations are necessary to meet the commitments set out in the conventions, the Minister should provide specific examples of the types of regulations that the Government intend to create under this broad power. If he did so, the Committee would be better able to assess the scope and impact of the regulations and determine whether they are necessary.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"Furthermore, the Government must be transparent in justifying the regulations they propose. It is essential for Parliament to know the precise nature of the regulations and how they will directly benefit seafarers and those working in the fishing industry. Article VI of the maritime labour convention outlines a series of fundamental rights for seafarers, including  ""the right to a safe and secure workplace…fair terms of employment…decent working and living conditions on board ship""  and  ""health protection, medical care, welfare measures and other forms of social protection.""",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"Given that those rights are clearly outlined and vital to the protection of seafarers, I ask the Minister: which of them are not already enforceable under UK law? Are there specific gaps in current legislation that prevent their effective enforcement? If so, will the Government provide clarity as to why those gaps have persisted for so long, and what specific measures are now being introduced to address them?",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"Additionally, I would appreciate clarification on whether there are any difficulties in implementing the responsibilities outlined in article V of the maritime labour convention. This article focuses on the implementation and enforcement of the convention's provisions, which are essential for protecting workers in the maritime sector. Have the Government encountered challenges in enforcing the responsibilities under current law?",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"If so, what specific issues have arisen, and how do the Government plan to resolve them? Providing these details will help us to better understand the need for the proposed legislative changes.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"Will the Minister clarify whether any of the provisions of the work in fishing convention are currently unenforceable under UK law? If so, what specific provisions are problematic, and what changes will be required to ensure that they can be effectively enforced? Given the significant risks faced by workers in the fishing industry, it is crucial that the provisions are enforced, so Ministers should provide a clear outline of the steps the Government intend to take to close any gaps in enforcement.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"Could this lead to unnecessary or intrusive burdens on businesses, workers or even individuals involved in maritime employment?",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"The Minister must clarify what the power entails and provide reassurance that it will not lead to overreach or misuse. To emphasise my concern further, I ask the Minister to point to any specific occasions when the Government's ability to enforce the provisions of the maritime labour convention has been found lacking. Can the Minister cite an example of where existing mechanisms were insufficient to uphold the conventions?",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"If such an example exists, I suggest that we focus on targeting solutions directly at the root of the problem, rather than resorting to broad, unchecked powers, as provided for in proposed new section 84B(4). This warrants focused action, not a sweeping Government mandate.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"Detaining a vessel can have significant financial and operational consequences, so it is critical to understand the scope and limits of the power.",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"What limits are in place to ensure that this power is not used in an arbitrary or disproportionate way? It is essential for Parliament to understand the boundaries of the power and to ensure that it cannot be misused in the future. This is not so much a Henry VIII clause as a Louis XIV clause, allowing the Government to do precisely what they like without any restriction of any description whatsoever.",STRIKE
Sir Ashley Fox,"I have serious concerns about the fact that regulations to implement international agreements, including those relating to maritime employment, are subject to the negative procedure. That means that Parliament could be denied the opportunity to debate the regulations in detail. Given the significant impact of the regulations on workers and employers alike, Parliament should be guaranteed the ability to discuss and scrutinise them thoroughly.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"The current approach of granting Ministers unchecked power is concerning and, as I have outlined, leaves little room for proper oversight. Moreover, the Government have introduced new clause 52 with very little opportunity for us to scrutinise its content. This rushed approach to legislation is discourteous to the House and undermines the democratic process.",GENERAL
Sir Ashley Fox,"With so many critical powers being handed to Ministers, we should have been given ample time to examine the proposal and assess its implications fully. We as lawmakers need to be able to better understand the necessity and potential consequences of the new clause.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,The whole suite of amendments and new clauses are in response to concerns that were rightly highlighted by all parties in condemning the P&amp;O debacle and its underlying motives to undercut existing UK workers and employment laws by transferring people to lower terms and conditions. It is about stopping that race to the bottom.,SECURITY
Justin Madders,"Members will recall the evidence from representatives of the sector in Committee sittings in November. They welcomed the provisions and were keen to see them introduced, because they wanted a level playing field. They did not want to be undercut by people who would seek to pay their staff the minimum necessary.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"I point out to Opposition Members that the conventions are already UK law. The measures in this group seek to ensure that when they are amended in future, there will be an opportunity to update our own laws to reflect any changes in the conventions. It was a fair question from the shadow Minister to ask what the conventions cover, and they obviously look at it important issues such as maximum hours of work, medical care, accommodation and access to food and drinking water.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The maritime labour convention has been amended several times, with new requirements coming in only last month for seafarers to be provided with food and drinking water free of charge during their engagement, as well as provisions in relation to personal protective equipment and ensuring that they have access to social connectivity while at sea. The new measures are important to improve the working conditions of seafarers, and we currently do not have a mechanism to update our own laws to reflect them.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,We now need powers in our own legislation to ensure that we can keep up to date with developments in maritime law and protections. The shadow Minister asked how the powers might be used.,STRIKE
Justin Madders,We need to ensure that the powers in the legislation enable us to keep up with those important protections.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,The point about the negative procedure was noted. The drafting indicates that the initial implementation of regulations will be done by the affirmative procedure and thereafter changes to the law will be made by the negative procedure on the basis that those will be much more modest.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"If we are going to ensure compliance with international obligations, it is important that those subject to them can document their compliance with the regulations. There is therefore a power to ensure that those records are produced to demonstrate compliance. That is not a departure from the existing arrangements.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,The powers that we seek to introduce are important to make sure that we keep up to date with the latest developments in international maritime law. It is important that there is a level playing field and that people doing this difficult and important work are protected. We must ensure that we never have a situation where employers such as P&amp;O attempt a race to the bottom and we must ensure that standards are maintained across the board.,STRIKE
Justin Madders,"New Clause 52  International agreements relating to maritime employment  ""(1) The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is amended as follows. (2) After section 84 insert-  'Part 3A  International agreements relating to maritime employment  84A International agreements relating to maritime employment  (1) The Secretary of State may by regulations make such provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to-  (a) the Maritime Labour Convention, adopted on 23 February 2006 by the International Labour Organisation, as it has effect from time to time;  (b) the Work in Fishing Convention, adopted on 14 June 2007 by the International Labour Organisation, as it has effect from time to time.

This is a consequential amendment to NC2 to ensure the implementation of the repeal of relevant provisions in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.",GENERAL
Mr Bedford,I believe that it is important that the Committee hear and debate in full every proposed amendment to this truly awful Bill.,GENERAL
Mr Bedford,I will take the time to outline why I believe this would be a step in the wrong direction.,GENERAL
Mr Bedford,"Prisons are essential for every functioning society. They serve out punishment, act as a deterrent and reform offenders. The prison guard-or screw, to use the colloquial vernacular-plays a crucial role in maintaining these key purposes.",GENERAL
Mr Bedford,"The prisons offer three incredible employment opportunities for my constituents in Mid Leicestershire, but I fundamentally believe that they would be deeply concerned about the provisions in these new clauses. What would happen in these prisons on strike day? Would prisoners be able to do as they pleased?",GENERAL
Mr Bedford,"Most importantly, for my constituents, who is there to stop these prisoners getting out of the prison grounds? We could have a situation whereby, within a short journey of Mid Leicestershire, hundreds of inmates are on the run. Furthermore, with the funding settlement that the Government have announced for rural areas such as Mid Leicestershire, it is questionable whether the police would be able to catch those who have escaped.",GENERAL
Mr Bedford,"I believe that the public would be particularly sceptical about new clauses 2 and 3 because of the riots that they have seen on prison grounds, which unfortunately have happened even when prison officers have been on the premises. For example, many remember the riots at Strangeways in 1990, which were caused by poor officer-prisoner relations and poor conditions on prison grounds. I am also concerned about the two-tier impact on police and prison officers.",GENERAL
Mr Bedford,"The policing profession is intrinsically linked to that of prison officers. Police officers are at the heart of keeping the public safe. Police officers throughout the UK join the profession willingly and, because of their professionalism, accept that they will never be able to strike.",EQUAL
Mr Bedford,"Police officers throughout the UK know how important it is to keep the public safe. In fact, many police officers I talk to express their annoyance at how little they can do to fight real crime when a lot of their time is taken up by other issues, such as non-crime hate incidents and investigating dubious posts on social media.",EQUAL
Mr Bedford,"However, the crux of the argument against new clauses 2 and 3 is public safety and the lack of supervision should they be accepted. I therefore hope that they are not added to the Bill.",STRIKE
Steve Darling (Torbay) (LD),"I am sure that my residents would be horrified that these proposals are seeing the light of day in the Committee. I am shocked that Conservative Members are putting them out there. I expected us just to pass on by them, but I want to make sure that it is on the record that the Liberal Democrats do not support these rather peculiar proposals, which have only seen the light of day thanks to a Conservative Member.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"It is important that we put on the record our appreciation for the work of prison officers. They work in difficult environments every day, dealing with very challenging people, and we recognise that they are critical to keeping the public safe.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Under the current legislation, prison officers are prevented from taking industrial action, and their pay is governed by the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body, which acts as a compensatory mechanism for that restriction.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,We need to ensure that everyone who works in a prison has the right to decent conditions and a fair reward for their hard work.,WAGES
Justin Madders,"The Government are committed to achieving that, but I believe that we can do so without the need for legislative change.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"A withdrawal of their services, as we have heard, even if only partial, would create a risk to order and to the life and limb of individuals. There are limited contingency plans in place to deal with strike action and, during such incidents, reliance on a narrow pool of operational managers and support from the police would create risks.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"I am sure that Members do not need that spelling out. This would also result in significant disruption to the operation of the courts and the police, representing a significant risk to public safety.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"I know that the POA is very keen, understandably, to have this proposal enacted.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"I understand their view, but we cannot agree to this at this point. I do not know whether the amendment will be pushed to a vote-I suspect that it will not be, from what the hon.",STRIKE
Steve Darling,"However, this is not about public ownership but is actually about non-disclosure agreements. Non-disclosure agreements were originally about keeping trade secrets but, over recent years, they have proliferated and, sadly, have kept shameful secrets away from the public eye in situations where light needs to be cast to make sure that things are tackled.",GENERAL
Steve Darling,"As for the bigger picture of where NDAs have been used at an industrial level, one only has to look at Harrods and the stories that have come up around sexual harassment. Part of the Bill is about trying to tackle harassment and sexual harassment.",EQUAL
Steve Darling,"As I alluded to with Mohamed al-Fayed, these were used at an industrial level when people were at a very confused stage, and were very vulnerable.",GENERAL
Steve Darling,We have already seen Ireland take this step.,STRIKE
Greg Smith,"Our challenge to the proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Torbay on behalf of the third party is about understanding where the shortfalls are in existing whistleblower legislation that make the amendment necessary. I heard what he said about his personal experience, but our analysis of the provisions of legislation that is active and live now, as we consider the new clause in Committee, shows that whistleblowing legislation already covers what he is trying to achieve.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"As has been said, NDAs can be used quite legitimately in different contexts and contracts. As the responsible Department for the use of NDAs in employment relationships, we recognise that they can have a legitimate role, such as to protect trade secrets, intellectual property and commercially sensitive information. Of course their most common use is in allowing workers and employers to reach a settlement on a dispute or a claim.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"It goes without saying that a worker may want to settle a dispute and receive the confidentiality protections associated with a settlement agreement to avoid going through an employment tribunal, which can be a distressing experience in itself. Having a non-disclosure agreement can also increase the value of such an agreement, depending how negotiations go.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"There are existing legal limits to the use of NDAs in the employment context. For example, any clauses of an NDA that sought to stop a worker blowing the whistle to a lawyer or a prescribed person under the legislation would not be enforceable. The use of an NDA by an employer may amount to a criminal offence if it is an attempt by the employer to pervert the course of justice or conceal a criminal offence.",STATUS
Justin Madders,"None the less, workers may not be aware of their rights.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"Member for Torbay mentioned, particularly in relation to sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying in the workplace. Last year, the Women and Equalities Committee inquiry into misogyny in music and the Treasury Committee inquiry into sexism in the City reported on the misuse of NDAs in specific sectors and industries. Their reports highlighted how NDAs can have a silencing effect on some victims, who come under pressure to sign an NDA and are not aware of their existing rights, and how NDAs may be a part of wider organisational cultures and practices for some employers.",EQUAL
Justin Madders,"Overall, those reports highlight that, while we have seen some progress and some positive developments, the issues in this space are multiple and persistent.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The Government are live to the concerns about the misuse of NDAs to intimidate and silence victims of crime and other types of misconduct, particularly harassment, discrimination, and bullying. The Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 contains a measure that, when commenced, will ensure that victims can report a crime, co-operate with regulators and access confidential advice and support without fear of legal action. It does so by providing that any clauses in NDAs seeking to prevent those actions cannot legally be enforced.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,The Ministry of Justice is carefully considering plans to bring the relevant section of that Act into force and will be working closely with the victim support and business sectors to ensure that the new measure is implemented and deployed effectively. We continue to listen carefully to representations on further action needed to curb the misuse of NDAs.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The specific wording that is proposed today would make any provision in an agreement precluding a worker from making a relevant disclosure that relates to harassment carried out by a fellow worker, or client of their employer, unenforceable. Under the consequential amendment, the measure would come into force on the day that this legislation is passed. I have some reservations about the amendment as drafted, as it would make a significant change from the current position and there might be unintended consequences.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,"To render provisions related to disclosures on harassment unenforceable could have negative effects on both workers and employers. A worker may want to settle a dispute over harassment and receive the confidentiality protections associated with a settlement agreement. The proposal may also impact on their ability to reach a settlement and avoid going to an employment tribunal, or may indeed reduce the value of such an agreement.",EQUAL
Justin Madders,"The amendment may also lead to uncertainty for both employers and workers who have entered into NDAs previously. The Government are looking into this. There is obviously some evidence, and there was a Government consultation, but that was some time ago, so we intend to look more closely at what we can do in this area.",STATUS
Justin Madders,"I have met some of the interested parties and there are other proposals to deal with this issue that might be slightly more workable than those in the new clause proposed by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson. I say to him that although we are aware of this issue and know it needs attention, we are not able to support the new clause.",GENERAL

I wonder whether the Liberal Democrats have a policy position on those matters; if they do, it seems rather trusting to just leave it up to the Government to determine, rather than setting it out in the new clause.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"New clause 15 defines what is meant by kinship care. There is some confusion here, because the Government have set out their definition of kinship care in the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which specifies that a child is in kinship care if  ""the child lives with a relative, friend or other person connected with the child for all or part of the time"",  or if the child lives with that person  ""for all of the time, or for more time than the child lives with a parent"",  and that person provides  ""all of the care and support provided for the child, or more of that care and support than is provided for the child by a parent.""

That is a vital part of our commitment to keeping families together and supporting children to achieve and thrive. That Bill defines kinship care as a situation in which a child lives with, and is cared for by, a relative, friend or someone else connected to them, instead of their parents, and that person provides all or most of the care and support to the child.",GENERAL

An employee may not automatically have parental responsibility as a result of being a kinship carer, but they may acquire parental responsibility through, for example, a legal guardianship order.",STATUS

It is not often that I agree with the Prime Minister's former chief of staff, but there were reports before the election that even she thought that was an unrealistic deadline, and events have proven her correct. It may embarrass the Minister or make him a little awkward every time I raise this point, but that will not stop me from stating the facts.",GENERAL

Greg Smith,"There is a strange doublespeak between the Government's stated aims for the Bill and its likely consequences. The Government's impact assessment says:  ""The objectives of the Bill are to…Improve industrial relations and reducing the number of days lost to strike action by allowing working people to organise collectively through trade unions and improving the legislative framework in which they operate."" How can the Government believe that the Bill will reduce the days lost to strike action when part 4 specifically takes measures to make strike action easier?",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"For example, it makes it easier for unions to be recognised by removing the requirement for a union to demonstrate that the proposed bargaining unit is 10% of its membership on application to the Central Arbitration Committee and replaces it with references to the ""required percentage test"", which will surely make strike action more likely. Part 4 also requires the Central Arbitration Committee to declare a trade union as recognised for collective bargaining purposes where the result of the ballot shows that a majority of those voting were in favour of union recognition. The additional requirement for the union to have at least 40% support in the bargaining unit has been deleted.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"We then come to the changes to ballot thresholds, which seem specifically designed to make it more, not less, likely that more days will be lost to industrial action.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"The Bill removes the requirement for at least 50% of trade union members entitled to vote to do so for an industrial action ballot to be valid. It also removes the requirement for trade unions in important public services to obtain the support of at least 40% of members entitled to vote in the ballot for industrial action to be successful and replaces that with a simple majority of those voting, with no requirements for any level of turnout. Can the Minister explain how that will make industrial action less likely?",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"Surely making it easier for trade unions to gain a mandate for strike action by removing sensible thresholds imposed by the previous Conservative Government will make strike action more likely, which is contrary to the Government's stated aims for the Bill. That is why it is so important for the consultation in new clause 19 to be laid before the House. That contradiction between the Government's stated intentions for part 4 and the result of the Bill, which is likely to be the opposite, is the first reason we believe the Government need to enact a proper consultation to prove that the Bill will work, which they should have done before introducing the Bill in the first place.",STRIKE

Greg Smith,"The next reason why a consultation is necessary before part 4 is commenced is the burden on employers, which is laced throughout part 4. Leaving aside the likely burden and cost of additional days of strike action, I want to ask for the Minister's assessment of the burden that the measures will place on employers. The requirement on an employer to provide an employee with a written statement of the worker's rights to join a trade union means more red tape, as do the trade unions' rights of access to workplaces.",STRIKE

Can the Minister explain how any of the above measures will enable employers to increase productivity, reduce costs or reduce red tape? Perhaps they are just another set of anti-growth measures from this Government, in contrast to their stated foundational mission of growth.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"Growth is important, and the measures that I have just mentioned from part 4 make that harder. That is why the consultation for which the new clause calls is so important. We come to the third reason that a consultation is necessary.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The Government have not done any evidence-based work-at least not publicly-on how effectively existing trade union legislation, in particular the balanced approach we introduced with the Trade Union Act 2016, is working and on how the proposals in part 4 of the Bill would change that. That basic level of due diligence is needed before part 4 can be commenced.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The required test for the percentage of the workforce that needs to support trade union recognition is to be determined by regulations. The definition of detriment that cannot be suffered as a result of taking industrial action is to be determined by regulations. A worker's right to have their employer provide them with a written statement of their right to join a trade union at the same time as they provide them with a statement of their employment particulars, and at further prescribed times, as specified under section 1 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, is to be set out in regulations.",GENERAL

Justin Madders,"The shadow Minister challenged me about how we can push the Bill forward, without there being questions as to whether it would lead to increased industrial action.

Justin Madders,"We can never say for sure that the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 will have any impact, because it has never been used.",STRIKE
Justin Madders,One of the fundamental weaknesses with that legislation was that it was so unworkable and so damaging to industrial relations that no one ever thought it was a sensible idea to implement it.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"So there was a lot of hot air and posturing in that previous legislation, and it was not conducive to good industrial relations.",GENERAL

The Chair,"With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment 120, in clause 118, page 105, line 20, at end insert-  ""(3A) But if the provisions of section [Right to switch off in relation to trade union representatives] have not been fully brought into force before the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed, that section (so far as not already in force) comes into force at the end of that period.""

Greg Smith,"We know that the Government would like to give employees the legal entitlement to disconnect from work-related communications during non-working hours, to ensure a healthier work-life balance. My understanding, and I would be grateful for the Minister's confirmation, is that this would apply to all forms of communication, including emails, phone calls and instant messaging. That is a burdensome requirement for employers.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"To ensure that they are complying with the eventual law, they are likely to need to establish clear boundaries for out-of-hours communication to protect employees' rights and avoid legal risks. In other words, they need another policy and then to enforce it. I accept that I am speculating a little, because we do not know whether the Government will impose a code of practice or legislation and exactly what that would contain, but I have made an educated guess, allowing for the Government's pronouncements so far.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"We think that any requirement placed on employers that restricts the contact that can be made with their employees should also apply to trade unions. Surely, it is damaging for employees' mental health to be contacted by their trade union reps around the clock.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"We have adopted our own definition of the right to switch off, in the absence of any clear definition yet from the Government. It amounts to this:  ""In every contract of membership of a trade union, whether made before or after the coming into force of this section, a term conferring a right on the member to refuse to monitor, read or respond to contact (or attempted contact) by a trade union representative outside their working hours shall be implied."" It is only fair to secure a balance between the requirements on employers and trade unions to respect mental health and wellbeing, and to allow employees and trade union members alike to secure a healthy work-life balance.",STATUS
Laurence Turner,"From experience of working in trade unions, it is clear that the new clause would block a trade union member who was negotiating to save a company or reach an agreement, say over a weekend, from checking communications during that time. Someone might also be a delegate to a conference, and there may be serious safeguarding concerns about their behaviour.",GENERAL
Laurence Turner,"Gentleman is making a didactic point, but does he accept that there would be very perverse consequences if the new clause were implemented?",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"Member for Birmingham Northfield has said is indicative-to be resisting those same provisions applying to trade unions. It seems to be a bit of a double standard, and it is one that the amendment and the new clause seek to address.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"There cannot be one rule for employers and another rule for the trade unions. It is a matter of fairness that we are proposing the new clause and the amendment, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response.",STRIKE
Michael Wheeler (Worsley and Eccles) (Lab),"Does the Minister agree that the new clause seems to have no relation to the world of work, and that Opposition Members might actually be living out the fantasy that they can switch off from us on the Government Benches?",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"If we start getting into the right to switch off from people we might not want to hear from, we could end up in a very dark place.",EQUAL
Justin Madders,"The shadow Minister will see from the reaction on the Government Benches that we have never had any issue with nuisance calls or pestering from trade unions when we have been in the workplace-it is really not like that at all. These proposals are indicative of the rather outdated idea that some Opposition Members have about how trade unions operate. Were they passed, one of the unintended consequences would undoubtedly be increased demand on facility time-something I am sure the shadow Minister would not be too pleased about.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The employment relationship is, of course, very different to membership of a trade union, because there is a division between home and working lives, and a recognition that that has to be respected.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Unfortunately, there is also an expectation that people should be constantly contactable outside of work hours. We will not be legislating to ban all communication outside of working hours; what we are looking to do is implement the statutory code of practice, which will set out clear expectations and obligations to get the balance right between allowing flexibility and making it clear that people's home lives should be respected. There will be a consultation on that in due course, and I am sure the shadow Minister can submit something about trade unions contacting people if he wants to do so, but I suspect he will be the only one who does.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"I am deeply hurt that the Minister will not take our new clause seriously. It is part of debate in this place, and our job as the Opposition, to test the boundaries of Government legislation.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The new clause has exposed a double standard within the Labour Government's approach to working practices, in that they seek to exempt trade unions but not employers.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,We tabled the new clause because we want to understand the cost-benefit analysis the Government have undertaken in relation to establishing the labour market enforcement body. Will the Minister inform the Committee about that work?,GENERAL
Greg Smith,"Specifically, whenever there is a reorganisation of the responsibilities between the Government and non-departmental public bodies, there are always logistical difficulties to manage, such as the transfer of staff and so on.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"The Government's own impact assessment of the establishment of the fair work agency is fairly damning:  ""Limited evidence and an incomplete design of the operational and organisational structure of the FWA mean that it has not been possible to quantity the impact of benefits arising from its introduction nor the majority of associated costs.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"Where costs have been calculated they are limited to the one-off costs faced by businesses in order to familiarise themselves with changes to the enforcement system. We estimate that these costs would be £33m.""  That is not my estimate, but the estimate in the Government's own impact assessment.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The Government have not been able to assess the costs of bringing together enforcement in this way and whether it represents value for money. As for the cost to business, the impact assessment is, again, not exactly glowing:  ""It is unclear what the total impact on business will be as a result of the creation of the FWA, this uncertainty is due to:…The operational and organisational design of the FWA not being finalised…Uncertain evidence on the number of employers and employees in scope of changes to labour market enforcement…Undetermined behavioural responses by both employers and employees as a result of the creation of the FWA."" On the direct cost to businesses, it says:  ""Businesses will face one off familiarisation costs due to the introduction of the FWA.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"We estimate that the costs of these changes would be £33m. Additionally, businesses who are subject to investigation will face costs even if they are later found to be compliant with relevant regulation. It is not possible to state the total number of affected businesses, but we estimate that an investigation would cost each investigated business £770."" That is not an inconsiderable sum just for the investigation, before anything else is found, particularly for our small and medium-sized enterprises.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"We may all agree that the fair work agency is a nice idea in principle, but the Government are introducing it, and it is their job to make sure they can demonstrate that it will work in practice and provide a better deal for taxpayers, employers and workers than they are getting now.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"For example, on the enforcement system for labour market legislation, the impact assessment states that  ""the Bill could increase the volume of cases in the 'individual enforcement'…system by around 15%, albeit this would be offset to some degree by the implementation of the Fair Work Agency (FWA). The exact impact on the enforcement system is difficult to predict because the number of cases that enter the system each year fluctuates, and it will ultimately depend on behavioural factors like employers' willingness and ability to comply with regulation, and employees' willingness to bring forward a dispute."" In other words, the Government are really not sure about the impact that the Bill will have on the number of enforcement claims being brought to tribunal and the ability of the tribunal system to cope.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"For all those reasons, we have tabled new clause 22, which would require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a report containing an assessment of the costs of establishing a single labour market enforcement body. Given the level of detail available so far, that would seem to be a reasonable and moderate requirement to enable Parliament to scrutinise the new agency and the value for money that it provides. It might even enable the Government to provide the House with a good news story.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,The only reason to resist the new clause would be if the Government thought that the new agency was not going to be such good news after all.,GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Let me start by explaining once again why we believe the fair work agency is so important. As we know, the current landscape for employment rights is, as was actually recognised by the previous Government, fragmented and in need of reform.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"As a Committee, we heard evidence from Margaret Beels, the Director of Labour Market Enforcement, that the current fragmentation creates a barrier to providing effective sector-wide enforcement. She noted that bringing powers together in the fair work agency would allow for better information sharing and a more flexible and adaptive approach to enforcement, enabling resources to be directed where they are most needed.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Other witnesses agreed with that assessment; indeed, I recall that a huge range of witnesses at the evidence sessions spoke in favour of a single enforcement body. The CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the British Retail Consortium, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, the Food and Drink Federation, the Co-operative or Co-op, the Women's Budget Group and the Work Foundation all spoke in favour of a single enforcement body.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"The shadow Minister mentioned the impact assessment, but the Bill was in fact green-rated by the Regulatory Policy Committee.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,There is a commitment to keep the performance and cost of the fair work agency under review. There will be a review three years after implementation of the agency.,SECURITY
Justin Madders,"As would be expected, merging different structures together is a complex task, so costings are still being developed at this stage.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Nevertheless, securing value for money is clearly a key consideration in that process.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Clearly, such change is very difficult to model in, but we hope that by establishing the fair work agency we will send a very clear signal that we expect employers to comply with the law, that the best standards should be adhered to, and that the race to the bottom should end. As a result of all that, we will see far better employment practices across the country.",SECURITY
Justin Madders,"The fair work agency will be part of the Department for Business and Trade, so its costs will be in the Department's accounts, which Parliament can scrutinise in the normal way. Once the agency is fully established, it will produce its own accounts as part of its reports, and those accounts will be consolidated into the Department's annual accounts, which, of course, will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.",GENERAL
Justin Madders,"Consequently, I do not believe that new clause 22 would add anything to the multiple channels that are already available for parliamentarians to establish and identify the costs and benefits of the agency.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The cost is important because it is ultimately both cost to the taxpayer and cost to our businesses which create all the wealth in the first place, which then gets taxed and pays for our public services.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"I invite the Minister to reflect on that, going forward. It is absolutely vital that the Government understand what things will cost before we make them happen, whether that is a Labour, Conservative or coalition Government-or whatever it might be.",GENERAL

Greg Smith,"Amendment 128 paired with new clause 24 would require the Secretary of State to conduct a review of the impact of the provisions on zero-hours workers before these clauses can be commenced. The Government's impact assessment suggests that the provisions in the Bill on the right to guaranteed hours will cost businesses around £160 million a year in administration needed for compliance-that is something, but not much, in terms of business costs.",STATUS
Greg Smith,"The Government also say:  ""The extent to which the policy will provide a net positive impact for total welfare will depend on (i) how well targeted the policy is at those facing detriment whilst retaining flexibility for those that value it, and (ii) the extent that wellbeing impacts of the policy feed through to productivity improvements for employers. As such, at this stage of policy development we deem the net impact on society as uncertain.""",STATUS
Greg Smith,"The justification for that assessment is:  ""The changes to Zero-Hour Contracts are expected to impact 2.4 million workers. The assessed impact of right to regular contract on the enforcement system is based on the frequency of cases within the jurisdictions of Part time worker regulations and written statement of terms and conditions. These jurisdictions represented 2.5% of all complaints to ETs in 22/23 and therefore an additional 2.4 million workers with the right to make a claim is expected to lead to a slight increase in cases.""",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"What analysis has been undertaken of the increased likelihood of claims, now that the Bill is giving employees both more enforceable rights and a longer period of up to six months to make a claim? Given the importance to employers of claims brought to tribunal being quickly resolved, I would appreciate further reassurance from the Minister on that point. That is also why we have tabled new clause 24, because we wish to make sure-given the uncertainty about the costs and benefits of the provisions on guaranteed hours because, as the Department acknowledges, much is being left to regulations-that the Government are confident the tribunal system can cope before the legal changes are commenced.",SECURITY
Greg Smith,"The Government admitted that they do not have robust data on the incidence of dismissal for those with under two years of employment. In other words, we do not know whether there is even the problem with unfair dismissal that the Bill seeks to solve.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"As discussed in Committee, we have concerns about the unfair dismissal provisions in the Bill, and those are shared by businesses. The Regulatory Policy Committee has said that the provisions on unfair dismissal rights are estimated to cost businesses around £43.2 million a year, although that is probably a rather wide estimate, as we do not know what policy decision the Government will make about the regulations.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,Parliament is being asked to hand this incompetent Government a blank cheque to make regulations that will implement the unfair dismissal provisions in the Bill.,STRIKE
Greg Smith,"The Government admit that the day one unfair dismissal rights could have negative impacts on employment and hiring, which could include incentivising employers to turn to temporary or fixed-term workers. The unfair dismissal rights could make it more difficult for the unemployed or economically inactive to access jobs, either through overall negative impacts on employment and/or a strengthening of insider power. Alex Hall-Chen from the Institute of Directors warned the Committee that  ""under the current system, employers are very likely to take a risk on hiring a borderline candidate who may not have quite the right experience or qualifications, but they will now be much less likely to take that risk because the cost of getting it wrong will be considerably higher.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"""--[Official Report, Employment Rights Public Bill Committee, 26 November 2024; c. 8, Q2.] I remind the Minister of what Jane Gratton of the British Chambers of Commerce said in evidence:  ""Members say that there would be a reduced hiring appetite were this legislation to come in, and that they would be less likely to recruit new employees due to the risk and difficulty, particularly under the day one rights, unless there were at least a nine-month probation period with a light-touch approach. ""--[Official Report, Employment Rights Public Bill Committee, 26 November 2024; c. 8, Q2.]",STATUS
Greg Smith,"The Government's own impact assessment is also relatively candid about this question. It states that  ""risks to employment will be highest for workers with the weakest attachment to the labour market, including: (1) the low-paid, who are already most likely to be let go from work in a downturn; (2) disabled workers, who face a large 'employment gap'; and (3) the youngest workers, since they are still gaining experience and skills.""",STATUS
Greg Smith,"In other words, the Government quietly agree with businesses that a lot could go wrong here.",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"In the Employment Act 2002, Labour created the procedures for statutory dispute resolution, which meant that a dismissal was automatically unfair unless the employer had followed the steps set out in the regulations-namely, sending the employee a written invitation to a meeting, conducting a meeting to decide whether or not to take the action in question, and allowing the employee to appeal. Those were then repealed by the Employment Act 2008, under the same Government, because there was a deluge of cases before the employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal concerning the procedures and their application. The Labour Government commissioned the Gibbons review, which recommended that the statutory procedures be abolished.",SECURITY
Greg Smith,"I am afraid we are likely to see a similar explosion in employment tribunal cases. Those cases will be expensive to defend, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, and may take a long time to resolve if the tribunal is not appropriately resourced. What assessment have the Government made of the likely increase in cases that will need to be dealt with by tribunal because of the unfair dismissal proceedings in the Bill?",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"The impact assessment says that the policy is expected to lead to additional early conciliation and employment tribunal cases, which carry additional costs to the employer. The impact assessment estimates that the unfair dismissal policy could lead to thousands of additional employment tribunal cases.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"Are the Government confident that the system can cope? The Minister will understand that I am sceptical of any assurance he can give now, because we do not know what regulations the Government are planning to make using the powers in the Bill, and the Government have said that much of the impact of this policy will depend on the design of the final regulations. We therefore think that once the policy work has been done and we know whether the Business Secretary or the Deputy Prime Minister has won the argument, and the Government know what they are doing, it is only right that the Government can reassure this House of the tribunal's ability to cope with additional claims.",GENERAL

Justin Madders,"Our analysis included illustrative analysis of the impact on employment tribunal cases, which we intend to refine over time by working closely with the Ministry of Justice, His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, ACAS and wider stakeholders. The quantifiable impact of the measures on zero-hours contracts is estimated to be an annual increase of about 1,000 additional cases for employment tribunals per year. That assessment was published at Second Reading and was based on the best available evidence for the potential impact on business, workers and the wider economy.",STATUS
Justin Madders,"We will also publish an enactment impact assessment once the Bill reaches Royal Assent, in line with the requirements of the better regulation framework.

I therefore assure the Committee that there is no need for the Bill to require the Government to undertake further assessment of the impact on tribunals before commencement, because we will do that as we go along.

Amendment 154, in clause 118, page 105, line 20, at end insert-  ""(3A) No provision of the following sections of this Act may be brought into force in accordance with subsection (3) until the Government has published the impact assessment specified in section [sections 1 to 6: impact assessment]-  (a) section 1 (Right to guaranteed hours);  (b) section 2 (Shifts: rights to reasonable notice);  (c) section 3 (Right to payment for cancelled, moved and curtailed shifts);  (d) section 4 (Amendments relating to sections 1 to 3);  (e) section 5 (Repeal of Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Act 2023);  (f) section 6 (Exclusivity terms in zero hours arrangements).""",STRIKE
Greg Smith,"Amendment 154, which is consequential on new clause 31, would require the Government to publish an impact assessment on the impact of clauses 1 to 6 on the hospitality, retail and health and social care sectors. The Government's impact assessment states that zero-hours contracts are most frequently used in the hospitality, retail and health and social care sectors, which is why new clause 31 would require the Government to conduct an impact assessment to understand how well those sectors are able to cope with the provisions before they come into force. In the social care sector, given the workforce challenges that we all know about, that is particularly acute, especially if the provisions are also extended to agency workers, as it is not clear how that would be workable.",STATUS
Greg Smith,"The impact assessment provided by the Government is for the guaranteed hours provisions across the economy as a whole, but we know that the impact will be more severe in particular sectors. The Government estimate that the administrative costs of facilitating the right to guaranteed hours will be around £160 million. Since healthcare and education are large employers of zero-hours contracts and agency workers, some of the impact will fall on His Majesty's Treasury.",GENERAL
Greg Smith,"On the provision of reasonable notice of shifts, the Government estimate that business behaviour will change so that fewer shifts are cancelled, but the value of unavoidable cancellations could still be as high as £120 million a year, although that will depend on the detail of the policy further down the line. That is a fairly cavalier attitude to take towards business costs, particularly, as we discussed earlier, given the requirements of some shift work in the sectors mentioned in new clause 31. Our new clause therefore attempts to encourage the Government to do the job properly and set out the costs to hospitality, retail and health and care sectors from clause 1 on the right to guaranteed hours; clause 2 on rights to reasonable notice for shifts; clause 3 on the right to payment for cancelled, moved and curtailed shifts; clause 4 on amendments relating to sections 1 to 3; clause 5 on the repeal of the Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Act 2023; and clause 6 on exclusivity terms in zero-hours arrangements.",WAGES

Amendments 153 and 154 seek to ensure that the proposed new impact assessment requirement comes into force on the day that the Bill is passed, and that the provisions in clauses 1 to 6 cannot be commenced until the impact assessment has been published.
